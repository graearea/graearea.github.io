to 10000m^2 contact (lol)
![no-cup](img/cup.jpeg)<br/>
These fit into the crappy Spa and Motamec sockets to increase friction and adjustability<br/>
£15 inc delivery or free with any of my mirror mounts

## Curved shims for Aero Screen mirrors

Fitting flat metal mirror brackets to a curved screen doesn't work without putting undue stress on the screen. A selection of these shims relieves that stress. available in black or white<br/>
2 pairs in different curved profiles<br/>
I can make them with the curve lengthways like in the photos, or widthways (be sure to mention which you want)
£15 inc delivery

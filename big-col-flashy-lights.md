# BigCol's Flashy LED Lights
![big-col](img/big-col.jpeg)

Caterham standard caravan rear lights are pretty terrible. the LED versions are excellent, I have a pair, but they're currently £520 and rarely in stock. One of my friend's (BigCol) bought some of these: [here](https://fristom.com/en/offer/rear-lamps/ft-320-led/) which look great and have animated sequential indicators (video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6HZJRQdKpQ)). 
![back-cowl](img/back-cowl.jpg) and he wanted them to fit his car properly. so here is the solution.

## How much?
* The cowls on their own are £80 including bolts and washers.
* lamp units from Bowers are about £75 delivered.
* I can supply the lot with the econoseal connectors fitted for £180 delivered which are drop-in replacements for the caterham clusters. 

## What are they like size-wise?
They're about the same size as the caterham caravan lights. Here they are compared to the £520 version (which as slightly smaller). they're big enough to cover the holes from the original caravan lights

## How to fit them:
* unbolt the old lights removing the cables.
* reattach the grommets to the new lights.
* measure and drill two 10mm holes 90mm apart to the sides of the central hole. (use masking tape to get it all central and level)
* get some loctite ready
* fit the lights with the supplied nuts and bolts. make sure you get them the right orientation as the indicator is animated (small arrow on face points outwards). The hex nuts attach the light to the cowl. then the wedge adaptors and the washers then the flanged M6 bolts.
* reconnect the econoseals through the rear panel.

## Gotchas:
* you may need to replace your flasher relay with an LED relay if you've not done this yet.
* you may need to add a subloom to the indicator tell-tale if it has a common ground [here](https://www.classiccarleds.co.uk/products/diode-harness-kit-for-led-indicator-turn-signal-warning-light-fix-kit?_pos=1&_sid=4bf7c148f&_ss=r_)

## But I have a carbon-fiber fetish...
Ok, then wrap them in carbon vinyl:

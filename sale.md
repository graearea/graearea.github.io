## What are you selling?
I'm selling 3D printed plugs that will fit into your Caterham's pedal to make it wider so you can easily "heel and toe". this is especially difficult in SV chassis cars where the gap can be up to 75mm.

I supply a 5mm plug on the right side, and two of 10, 15 or 20, 25, 30 mm extension plugs on the left to bridge the gap. 

In my S3 chassis I have a 50mm gap in which I use a 15mm plug and in my size 8 driving boots, it's perfect. 35mm seems pretty good to me and is about 1/3 of the width of my foot.

## how do I order?
first, look at your pedals. 
is it like the old style ![old](/img/old.png)  \
or the new style ![new](/img/new.png)  

what is the distance between your brake and your accelerator?  
![new](/img/measure-s3.png)  

I think 35mm is about right in really narrow driving shoes. if you use wider ones, tell me.

* for an S3 chassis, 90% of people are happy with a 10-15mm plug so I'll send you a 10 and a 15.  
* for an SV chassis it is extremely variable. you need to tell me what you want and I'll send you a 15 and a 25 or something similar

### FAQ
- How heavy are they?
    - 24g with a steel bolt. even less if you find a Ti bolt. even less if you epoxy it in.
- How strong is it?
    - Strong enough. You're not driving a transit van in steel toecaps, you're wearing ballet shoes. they're printed with a honeycomb infil (look above) and 6 layers of PLA walls. tap them, they sound high pitched cos they're so stiff.
- What happens if it snaps and I crash my car
    - This product is used entirely at your own risk. but it's not your brake pedal, it'll likely be fine.
- I don't want to take my pedal out.
    - If you cut down an allen key you can just about get in there to fit it. I've done it twice, but it's a pain in the shoulder. Seriously, just take the pedal out for the fitting.
- I think it's rubbish, I want my money back.
    - OK, send it back and I'll refund you if I've even charged you.
- I want a custom colour.
    - OK. It'll cost you another £5
- I want a custom size width or height
    - OK. It'll cost you another £5
- How tight do I make it?
    - Not very. Tweak it up a bit, if you hear cracking noises, stop!
- Do I need to bolt it? Will it friction fit?
    - Maybe. I suspect a bit of superglue or epoxy would fix it in place as the plugs have deep insertion but I haven't tried this.
- What size do I get?
    - measure your gap between the pedal. I _estimate_ it should be around 35-40mm get a plug that fits to that
- How eco-friendly are they?
    - apart from the fact your car runs on fermented dinosaurs... the plastic itself is plant-based, renewable and it is eventually biodegradeable. The bags I use are 100% recycled and recyclable. the delivery man probably runs on pies.
- I want to give you some feedback
    - please do! just email me at 3d@johnrae.com .
- Did you enjoy making these?
    - I did. The idea, design and print was fun, but the posting out 20 packages SUCKS. I should charge more for the postage.
- I think this is the best thing ever, how do I ever repay you?
    - Firstly, send me a photo of it on your car.
    - Secondly I accept beer money tips.
    - Thirdly, leave a review on the forum page.
    - Fourthly, get out and kick some downshifts!

## Delivery:
Usually delivery is within a week, sometimes it is a little more, sometimes it's next day. If you need it rushing, please get in touch. International delivery is _usually_ about £15 to the US, Japan or Oz, around £9 to France, etc. 
## Colours:
I have many colours available in PLA. In PETG generally only black and grey. not all products are available in PLA as it is not stable under high temperature. if you have a special request, just ask as I may be able to help.

Usually delivery is within a week, sometimes it is a little more, sometimes it's next day. If you need it rushing, please get in touch and I can often expedite it. International delivery is _usually_ about £15 to the US, Japan or Oz, and around £9 to France, Germany etc. 
## Payment:
Payment is arranged by bank transfer or paypal to my wife Suki's account. you will receive an email within day or two after you order with details. <b>if you've not received an email, please **check your spam-folder** and/or get in touch via john@uberniche.co.uk </b> 
## Colours:
I have many colours available in PLA. In PETG generally only black and grey. not all products are available in PLA as it is not stable under high temperature. if you have a special request, just ask as I may be able to help.

# GraeArea's Pedal Extension Plugs FAQ
![plugs](/img/plugs.png)

## What have I got?
You should have a 3D printed, 5mm or 10mm threadless plug and then some 10, 15 or 20 mm extension plugs. or an empty plastic bag care of yodel. 

## Fitting
**Firstly, this is easiest with the pedal off:**
* Undo the top of the pedal box (6 screws and one bolt (on mine)) 
* Detach the throttle cable 
* Undo the bolt of the accelerator pivot (13mm open spanner)
* Remove pedal
* Congratulations, you've not dislocated your shoulder like you will trying to do this with the pedal on the car.

* 
NB. All pedals on caterhams are _slightly_ different so either I get you to measure your pedal with a set of calipers or I send you a plug that _might_ need 5 minutes of filing for it to fit. 

**Fit the plugs into the pedals**
* If you struggle getting them in, try spinning them a bit. the plugs are slightly oval as many pedals are oval.
* If they still won't fit, find the spot where they almost go in and then file a little off the widest part of the insertion part on opposite sides of the plug like this:
*

* (note the printing pattern of the part is not indicative of the wide bit)
* First press the 10/15/20/etc extension plug into the left side. This should go in with a bit of a shove. If you have the (S3) 15mm and 10mm, try the 15mm as that's what I'm using.
* Press fit the 5mm/10mm plug into the right hand side. This should go in with a bit of a shove. Most of these I sent out are round so should fit easily
* Once they're both in, put the bolt through the 5mm and then tighten down finger tight. Don't overtighten it, the bolt just needs to hold it together not take any stress if you hear cracking noises you're tight enough (this is fine). If you're worried about it backing out, stick some loctite in 

**Refit your pedal**
* Same but in reverse. Refitting the throttle cable can be easier if you relieve the tension from the throttle body.

### FAQ
- How heavy are they?
  - 24g with a steel bolt. even less if you buy a Ti bolt. even less if you epoxy it in.
- How strong is it?	
  - Strong enough. You're not driving a transit van in steel toecaps, you're wearing ballet shoes. they're printed with a honeycomb infil and 6 layers of PLA walls. tap them, they sound high pitched. 
- I don't want to take my pedal out. 
  - If you cut down an allen key you can probably just about get in there to fit it. I've done it twice, but it's a pain in the shoulder. Seriously, just take the pedal out for the fitting.
- I think it's rubbish, I want my money back. 	
  - OK, send it back and I'll refund you.
- I want a custom colour. 	
  - OK. It'll cost you another £5
- I want a custom size width or height	
  - OK. It'll cost you another £5
- How tight do I make it? 
  - Not very. Tweak it up a bit, if you hear cracking noises, stop!   
- Do I need to bolt it? Will it friction fit?	
  - Maybe. I suspect a bit of superglue or epoxy would fix it in place as the plugs have deep insertion but I haven't tried this.
- What size do I get?
  - I'm currently sending out a 20mm to SV owners and 10mm & 15mm to S3 owners. This may change following feedback.
- How eco-friendly are they?
  - apart from the fact your car runs on fermented dinosaurs... the plastic itself is plant-based, renewable and it is eventually biodegradeable. The bags I use are 100% recycled and recyclable. the delivery man runs on pies.
- I want to give you some feedback
  - please do! just email me at 3d@johnrae.com .
- Did you enjoy making these?
  - I did. The idea, design and print was fun, but the posting out 20 packages SUCKS. I should charge more for the postage.
- I think this is the best thing ever, how do I ever repay you?
  - Firstly, get a grip. 
  - Secondly I accept beer money tips. 
  - Thirdly, leave a review on the forum page.
  - Fourthly, get out and kick some downshifts!

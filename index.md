# GraeArea's Pedal Extension Plugs FAQ

#Please read the below

## What have I got?
you should have a threadless plug, usually a 5mm or 10mm with a 6mm bolt through it and then some 10, 15 or 20 mm extension plugs depending on if you bought the SV or S3 kit. 

##How do I fit them

**Firstly, this is easiest with the pedal off**. to do this:
* undo the top of the pedal box (6 screws) 
* detach the throttle cable 
* undo the bolt of the accelerator pivot
* pull out pedal
* congratulations, you've not dislocated your shoulder like you will trying to do this with the pedal on the car.

NB. All pedals on caterhams are _slightly_ different so either I get you to measure your pedal with a set of calipers or I send you a plug that _might_ need 5 minutes of filing for it to fit. 

**Fit the plugs on the pedals**
* press fit the 5mm/10mm plug into the right hand side. this should go in with a bit of a shove. most of these I sent out are round so should fit easily
* press the 10/15/20/etc extension plug into the left side. this should go in with a bit of a shove.
* if you struggle getting them in, try spinning them a bit. the plugs are slightly oval as many pedals are oval.
* if they still won't fit, find the spot where they almost go in and then file the widest part of the insertion part on opposite sides of the plug like this:![this](/img/filed.png) (note the pattern of the part is not indicative of the wide bit)

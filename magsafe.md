# Apple Magsafe Phone Mount
![magsafe-dash](img/magsafe-dash.jpg)
Apple Magsafe phone mount. attaches to the scuttle with M3 VHB tape. you don't need to use the poppet bolts. I have mine off-centre so that I can still use it with my aero screen (tested up to 80mph on the motorway). there are 2 versions, pivot and fixed. the pivot is slightly higher to clear the IVA trim if you still have it, the fixed will not.

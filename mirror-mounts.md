# Custom Mirror Mounts
![mounted](img/mounted.jpeg)

## The Problem.
Caterham's OEM homologated mirrors are terrible. They're enormous and because they're flat glass, you can't see anything. The original Eccles mounts, even though they're a great design are only attached at the hinge so are prone to shaking. 

## My solution
My mounts take Spa or Motamec convex mirrors, which means you can change lane without just guessing if you're going to die.

The mounts use the same hinge design as the Eccles mounts, but with the **third mounting bolt** which hooks into the previously drilled hole that your standard Caterham mirrors mounted into. This creates much more stiffness than the original mounts and stops the vibration of the mirror.

There is also an access hole so that you can access the tightening screw for the Spa mirrors.

As all holes drilled for Caterham mirrors are different, all the mounts need to be unique. Left side, right side, both different and custom.

## How do they compare to my cheaper Caterham adapters?
[These adapters ](https://uberniche.co.uk/caterham-spa-adapters) are half the price and no measuring needed! The custom ones are more rigid as they're braced in 2 dimensions, but there's not a lot in it.

## How much are they?
**Â£80 including delivery**. I'll make them, send them out, if they'res any problems with fitment we will fix them.

## Are they any good?
I ran them for a year and did 5000 miles including 5 track days and no problems. I've sold dozens of these now and I've had no complaints! I eventually switched to the lifeline solution as the mirrors are much better quality than the Spas (specifically the pivot ball-joint)

here is a video here from the Karussell on the Nurburgring. If that doesn't make your mirrors shake nothing will. click on it:

## What do they look like?
They are 3D printed, so they typically look like this with the carbon fibre weave effect:

The front side has a pattern from the printing which you can make out in bright light, the back side is dull.

## Are they strong enough?
Yes. They're much stronger than you'd think. I've snapped one, but it took a bench vice and a hammer. They look like this inside:

## How do I order?
The instructions are in the form.  
<b>-->[use this form to order](https://forms.gle/Zv4qKe691JE5V2q48)<-- </b> I'll post them out. If you're happy, great, if you're not, I'll refund you. (I've sold dozens, this has never happened)

## What comes in the kit?
* 2x custom mounts
* 4x 25mm M5 countersunk bolts for the hinge attachment
* 2x 25mm M5 countersunk bolts for the bottom attachment
* 2x 14mm M5 countersunk bolts for the mount-mirror bolt
* 2x mirror cups to stop the Spa mirror pivots sucking so badly

## What do I need?
* 2x Spa/Motomec/CBS mirrors (buy the convex spa ones [here](https://www.merlinmotorsport.co.uk/s/mirrors/spa-mirrors/spa-formula-and-caterham-mirrors) or [here](https://www.demon-tweeks.com/uk/spa-design-formula-high-impact-nylon-race-mirror-246438/) or the motamecs [here](https://www.motamec.com/motamec-racing-formula-f1-car-wing-mirror-x2-convex-glass-swivel-mount-black.html ) (note that https://www.kitcardirect.co.uk/spa-style-formula-f1-wing-mirror-carbon-pair.html seem to be motamecs)
* 2x Side screens that have been drilled.
* 2x original Caterham brass door hinge pivots (just gently tap them out of the existing pivots by the pointy end. The end that is inserted is knurled, or you can get them [here](https://caterhamparts.co.uk/fittings/599-wind-protector-hinge.html) or [here](http://www.kitcardirect.co.uk/shop-kit-car/weather-protection/wet-weather-side-door-hinges-each.html)). note that if you have an SV, you may have the silver pins. if these can't be tapped out, either replace them with brass, or get in touch and I may be able to adjust the design.
* 8x original nyloc nuts and washers from hinge and mirrors.

## How do I fit them?
* Open 1 beer (Your choice. My preference is something hoppy like a Siren or a Landlord)
* test fit mounts, just drop the bolts through and check it all lines up. if a mistake has been made during measurement, this is the time to find out.
* unscrew lower hinge from screen.
* tap out brass hinge pivot (it's knurled on the end that is inserted) by putting the hole above a gap in a vice or on the edge of a bench and tapping it out by the pointy end. 
* take brass hinge pivot and tap it into your new mount. it goes in smooth, pointy end first and should grip onto the knurled end.
* don't tap it in upside down!
* With the screws inserted, offer up the Spa mirror to the car and set the angle of the mirror correct.  
* once mirror is perfect, tighten the spa mirror down hard and the bolt mount to side screen with your nyloc nuts.
* enjoy worrying that now your rear-view mirror vibrates more than your wing mirrors (I have a solution for that!).
* enjoy ignoring everything behind you anyway.

## Can I use either Motamec or Spa mirrors
Yes, although I personally think the Spa mirrors are better as they're more convex and a little stiffer (comparison [here](https://www.caterhamlotus7.club/forum/techtalk/motamec-vs-spa-mirrors-0)). they are a bit more finicky to fit and adjust though. you'll need to countersink the bolt holes on your motamec mounts for the bolts to be the right length.

## What if you think they're rubbish?
cut them in half with a saw, send me a photo them, I'll refund you. this has never happened

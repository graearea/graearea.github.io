# GraeArea's custom mirror mounts

[TOC]

## The Problem.
Caterham's mirrors are terrible. Seriously. They're enormous and because they're not convex, you can't see anything. 

## My solution
My mounts take Spa/Motamec convex mirrors, which means you can change lane without just guessing if you're going to die.
They're _inspired by_ (ripped off from) Eccles' mounts (shown below mine here) but I can make them better and still supply them at a "reasonable" price.
As all holes drilled for Caterham mirrors are different, all the mounts need to be unique. Left side, right side, both different and custom.

## How are they better?
They are mounted to your side-screens at 3 points, not 2. That's 300% better! They use the same hinge design as Eccles's mounts, but they have a third screw, which hooks into the previously drilled hole that your standard Caterham mirrors mounted into. This creates much, much more stiffness than the original mounts. There is also an access hole so you can access the tightening screw for the mirrors. 

## So they're perfect?
They still vibrate a little with your side screen, but much less than the original Eccles as they're attached to the metal frame of the window. See the video below. 

## How much are they?
The first 5 sets will be £60+£4, I'll make them, send them out, receive feedback, fix any problems and then they'll be **£80+£4 p+p**.

## Are they any good?
I've been running them for a few months now and have done >2000 miles and no problems. click the video:

## Are they strong?
Yes. They're much stronger than you'd think. I've snapped one, but it took me sticking it in a bench vice and smacking it with a hammer. 

## How do they compare to the Aluminium Eccles?
I've seen the aluminium ones and they're the real deal, nicely CNC'd. These are 3D printed, so they typically look like this:

## What comes in the kit?
* 2x custom mounts
* 4x 16mm M4 countersunk bolts.
* 2x 25mm M4 bolts. 

## What do I need?
* 2x Spa mirrors (buy the convex ones here: http://www.kitcardirect.co.uk/spa-formula-f1-mirror.html or the motamecs here: https://www.motamec.com/motamec-racing-formula-f1-car-wing-mirror-x2-convex-glass-swivel-mount-black.html )
* 2x Side screens that have been drilled. 
* 2x original caterham brass door hinge pivots (if you have side-screens on your car you already have these)
* your 6 original nuts

## How do I fit them?
* Drink 1 beer (Your choice. My preference is something hoppy like a Beavertown or a Landlord)
* unscrew lower hinge from screen.
* test fit mounts, just drop the bolts through and check it all lines up. if a mistake has been made, this is the time to find out.
* tap out brass hinge pivot (it's knurled on the end that is inserted) by putting the hole above a gap in a vice or on the edge of a bench and tapping it out by the pointy end. 
* take brass hinge pivot and tap it into my mount, like this:

* don't tap it in upside down!
* With the screws inserted, offer up the Spa mirror to the car and set the angle of the mirror correct. This is easier with someone inside the car directing you.  
* once mirror is perfect, tighten the spa mirror down hard and the bolt mount to side screen with your nyloc nuts.
* enjoy worrying that now your rear-view mirror vibrates more than your wing mirrors (fix the rear-view with 3M VHB, it's much better than the foam crap people use).
* enjoy ignoring everything behind you anyway.

## How do I order? 
you need to measure the distance between your two hinge mounts and the first hole on your current mirrors. Here is an example:
![Caliper](/img/calipers.png)
The best way to do this is with calipers, the second best is with a tape-measure. If you get it wrong, and you need a slightly different version, I'll ask you for £10 each mount (which covers some of the time, materials and postage) and I'll redo it and send it out.
use [this form to order](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdEiVhoQxi8kPbPvGLiXffP9oAIh_V-uYGKmPjTSUhbPW-OPA/viewform?usp=sf_link)

Once you have the measurements, send me an email, I'll post them out. If you're happy, you send me the money. If you're not, you return them.

## What if you think they're shit?
I've sent them to you without charging you. Just send them back, don't pay me any money. Same as my pedal extension plugs. I'm currently at 50 sets of plugs and zero refunds requested.

## Do you do different colours from black?
Yes! for £5 more I can do a colour that I have filament for (currently Orange, Red, Green, Grey, Blue). I can do others but cost will be more. I'm not guaranteeing colour tone.

## How can you ask for this much money for so little?
It takes time to modify the designs for each mount.<br>
I stand by the product's quality.<br>
I just made a thing which I think is a massive improvement over the alternatives.<br>

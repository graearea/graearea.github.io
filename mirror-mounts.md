## The Problem.
Caterham's mirrors are shite. Seriously. They're not convex, you can't see anything and they're enormous. 

## The Previous Solution
Eccles Mounts. They can take Spa convex mirrors, which means you can change lane without just guessing if you're going to die.
but they're a bit wobbly. Too much vibration.

## My solution
Rip off Eccles' mounts but make them better and supply them _as a service_, at a "reasonable" price.

## How are they better?
They are mounted to your screens at 3 points, not 2. That's 300% better. They use the same hinge mounts as Eccles's mounts, but I offer a third mount, which hooks into the previously drilled hole that your crappy Caterham mirrors mounted into. This creates much, much more stiffness than the original mounts. 

## So it's perfect?
It still vibrates with your side screen, but much less than the original Eccles. See the videos below. 

## How much are they?
The first 5 sets will be £60+£4, I'll make them, send them out, receive feedback and then they'll be £80+£4. All my mounts are unique as every hole drilled for Caterham mirrors is different, which means they're all custom. Left side, right side, all custom. But because I can print them each individually, it's the time spent with custom editing my design that you're paying for, not the materials and tooling and all that. You're buying a service, not £3 of plastic.

## Are they any good?

ROCK. SOLID.
I've been running them for a few months now and done 3000 miles. 

## Are they strong?
Yes. I've snapped one with a hammer, but it took sticking it in a bench vice. PLA is much stronger than you'd think.

## How do I order?
send me a message, I'll send them out. If you're happy, you send me the money. If you're not, you return them.
you need to measure the distance between your two hinge mounts and the first hole on your current mirrors. Here is an example:

The best way to do this is with calipers, the second best is with a tape-measure. If you get it wrong and you need a slightly different version, I'll ask you for £10 (which covers some of the time, materials and postage) 

## What if I think they're shit?
I've probably sent them to you without charging you. Just send them back, don't pay any money. Same as my pedal extension plugs. I'm currently at 50 sets of plugs and zero refunds requested. 

## What comes in the kit?
2x custom mounts
2x M4 countersunk bolts.
2x other M4 bolts. 

## What do I need?
2x Spa mirrors (buy the convex ones here: http://www.kitcardirect.co.uk/spa-formula-f1-mirror.html or https://www.merlinmotorsport.co.uk/s/mirrors/spa-mirrors/spa-formula-and-caterham-mirrors )
2x Side screens that have been drilled. 
4x original bolts for your screen mounts. 
2x original caterham brass door hinge pivots (if you have screens on your car you already have these)
some loctite

## How do I fit them?
Drink 1 beer (your choice. My preference is something hoppy like a Beavertown or a Landlord)
unscrew lower hinge from screen.
test fit mounts, just drop the bolts through and check it all lines up. 
tap out brass hinge pivot (it's knurled on the end) like this: 

take brass hinge pivot and tap it into my mount, like this:

don't tap it in upside down!
attach Spa mirror. Offer it up to the car and get the angle absolutely perfect first time (don't worry, this is impossible. It'll take 15 attempts over the next 6 months. Blame the SPA mirrors.)
once mirror is perfect (lol) attach mount to side screen.
enjoy worrying why your rear view mirror vibrates more than your side screens.
enjoy ignoring everything behind you.

## Do you do different colours from black?
Yes! for £5 more I can do a colour that I have filament for (currently Orange, Red, Green, Grey, Blue) if you want some silly filament colour I can do it for the cost of the filament (usually 20/30 quid) but these include flip colours, rusting copper, wood, your mum's favourite colour and carbon fibre PLA. I'm not going to match the filament to your 1986 Rover paint code. If you care that much, send me the filament after you've checked it yourself.

## how can you ask for this much money for so little?
this isn't my job. 
I just made a thing which I think is a massive improvement.

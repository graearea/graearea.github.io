# Custom Mirror Mounts
![mounted](/img/mounted.jpeg)

## The Problem.
Caterham's mirrors are terrible. Seriously. They're enormous and because they're not convex, you can't see anything. 

## My solution
My mounts take Spa/Motamec convex mirrors, which means you can change lane without just guessing if you're going to die. They're _inspired by_ (ripped off from) Eccles' mounts (shown below), but they are mounted to your side-screens at 3 points, not 2. That's 300% better! 

They use the same hinge design as Eccles's mounts, but with the third bolt, which hooks into the previously drilled hole that your standard Caterham mirrors mounted into. This creates much, much more stiffness than the original mounts and stops the vibration of the mirror. 

There is also an access hole so that you can access the tightening screw for the Spa mirrors.

As all holes drilled for Caterham mirrors are different, all the mounts need to be unique. Left side, right side, both different and custom.

## How much are they?
The first 5 sets will be **£60+£6, but you pay me after you're happy**. I'll make them, send them out, receive feedback, fix any problems, and then you pay.

## Are they any good?
I've been running them for a few months now and have done >2000 miles including 3 track days and no problems. click the video:

## Are they strong enough?
Yes. They're much stronger than you'd think. I've snapped one, but it took me sticking it in a bench vice and smacking it with a hammer. they look like this inside:

## How do they compare to the aluminium Eccles?
I've seen the aluminium ones, and they're the real deal, nicely CNC'd. These are 3D printed, so they typically look like this:

The back side (bottom in this picture), often has some small irregularities, but this is the face that you can't see so it's not so big an issue. The front side has a pattern from the printing which you can make out in bright light.  

## How do I order?
you need to _very carefully_ measure the distance between _the centres_ of your top and bottom hinge mount holes and _the centre_ of the first hole on your current mirrors. Here is an example of measuring the bottom distance:
![Caliper](/img/calipers.jpeg)
The best way to do this is with calipers or a ruler, NOT a tape-measure. I need the measurements in mm.

Once you have the measurements, <b>-->[use this form to order](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdEiVhoQxi8kPbPvGLiXffP9oAIh_V-uYGKmPjTSUhbPW-OPA/viewform?usp=sf_link)<-- </b> I'll post them out. If you're happy, you send me the money, If you're not, you return them.

## What comes in the kit?
* 2x custom mounts
* 4x 20mm M5 countersunk bolts for the hinge attachment
* 2x 25mm M5 countersunk bolts for the bottom attachment
* 2x 14mm M5 countersunk bolts for the mount-mirror bolt

## What do I need?
* 2x Spa/Motomec/CBS mirrors (buy the convex spa ones [here](http://www.kitcardirect.co.uk/spa-formula-f1-mirror.html) or the motamecs [here](https://www.motamec.com/motamec-racing-formula-f1-car-wing-mirror-x2-convex-glass-swivel-mount-black.html )
* 2x Side screens that have been drilled.
* 2x original caterham brass door hinge pivots (just gently tap them out of the existing pivots by the pointy end. The end that is inserted is knurled, or you can get them [here](https://caterhamparts.co.uk/fittings/599-wind-protector-hinge.html) or [here](http://www.kitcardirect.co.uk/shop-kit-car/weather-protection/wet-weather-side-door-hinges-each.html))
* 8x original nyloc nuts and washers from hinge and mirrors.

## How do I fit them?
* Drink 1 beer (Your choice. My preference is something hoppy like a Siren or a Landlord)
* unscrew lower hinge from screen.
* test fit mounts, just drop the bolts through and check it all lines up. if a mistake has been made, this is the time to find out.
* tap out brass hinge pivot (it's knurled on the end that is inserted) by putting the hole above a gap in a vice or on the edge of a bench and tapping it out by the pointy end. 
* take brass hinge pivot and tap it into your new mount. it goes in smooth, pointy end first and should grip onto the knurled end.
* don't tap it in upside down!
* With the screws inserted, offer up the Spa mirror to the car and set the angle of the mirror correct.  
* once mirror is perfect, tighten the spa mirror down hard and the bolt mount to side screen with your nyloc nuts.
* enjoy worrying that now your rear-view mirror vibrates more than your wing mirrors.
* enjoy ignoring everything behind you anyway.

## Do you do different colours from black?
Yes! for £5 more I can do a colour that I have filament for (currently Orange, Red, Green, Grey, Blue). I can do others but cost will be more. I'm not guaranteeing colour tone.

## What if you think they're shit?
cut them in half with a saw, photo them, and I'll refund you anything charged.

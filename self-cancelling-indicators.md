#Self Cancelling Indicators

I totally HATE the indicating system on the Caterham. I was forever forgetting to stop the indicator and it was just a matter of time before somebody pulled out on me as they thought I was indicating to turn before them. 

so I had a bit of a think and came up with an idea. 

* an accelerometer to understand when cornering or not 
* some buttons on the wheel
* some logic for handling the on/off state
* an interface with the car

#Self Cancelling Indicators

I totally HATE the indicating system on the Caterham. I was forever forgetting to stop the indicator and it was just a matter of time before somebody pulled out on me as they thought I was indicating to turn before them. 

so I had a bit of a think and came up with an idea. 

* an accelerometer to understand when cornering or not 
* some buttons on the wheel
* some logic for handling the on/off state
* an interface with the car

First off, I'm a software developer and so I know _just_ enough to be dangerous with technology. I knew nothing about electronics, hadn't ever used a microcontroller and didn't really know how to do any of this. all of my knowledge came from the ability to use google and youtube :D. 
my first prototyoe was a prototype board with some buttons and LEDs

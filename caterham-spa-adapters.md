# Caterham to Spa/Motamec mirror adapters 

![adapter-fitted.png](img/adapter-fitted.jpeg)

## The Problem.
Caterham's mirrors are terrible. Seriously. They're enormous and because they're not convex, you can't see anything. The original Eccles mounts are only attached at the hinge so are prone to shaking. 

## My solution
These adapters are a simple solution to allow a Spa or Motamec convex mirror to be fitted, which means you can change lane without just guessing if you're going to die.
they use a brass insert to give a strong anchor and the front bolt goes all the way through.

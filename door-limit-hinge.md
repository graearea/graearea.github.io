# Door Limiting Hinge
![hinge](img/hinge.jpeg)
Do your door mirrors hit your windscreen when all the doors are open?
using Caterham hinges means that when your door opens too much,so it will sit with the mirror hitting your windscreen. 
this means your mirrors are bumped every time you open your door fully.

I've designed some hinge replacements which limit the amount of opening so that the doors don't hit the windscreen.

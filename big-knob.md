# Big Knob 
![big-knob](img/big-knob.jpeg)

Can you pull your knob when you're in your strapped down tight?

no, me neither. I thought I was gonna do myself a right whoopsie trying to reach my heater knob whilst in my 6-point harness.

so I made myself a bigger knob. in fact, I've now got 2 knobs. a big (50mm) one and an uber (70mm) one for people with arms like a T-Rex.

they're PETG and so they'll take the heat under the dash and they have a brass insert (just like the original) but they are much longer.

black only, I could probably do you a custom 100mm one, but I reckon the 70mm looks massive in my hands.

£15 for either size + £3 p+p

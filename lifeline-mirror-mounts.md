# Lifeline Mirrors and adaptors 

![lifeline-wide.jpg](img/lifeline-wide.jpg)

## The Problem.
* Caterham's mirrors are terrible. Seriously. They're enormous and because they're not convex, you can't see anything. The original Eccles mounts are only attached at the hinge so are prone to shaking because of the leverage on the 10cm long part.
* Spa Mirrors have a pretty crappy mount that is not easily adjustable without entirely removing the mirror. I do offer some friction cups that help with this, but it's still internal adjustment.
* Motamec Mirrors are not very convex at all which makes them useless, but at least have a grub-screw to tighten mirror in place. They have "Objects in the mirror are closer than they appear" written on them. 

## Lifeline Mirrors
They are convex, externally adjustable, very sturdy and have short arms. The large M6 Bolt they use for stability means they won't go through the existing holes in the doors. They unfortunately come with an imperial size 4 grub screw which is absolutely tiny and no-one has the hex key for.

## My Solution
I've designed some very stiff, _articulated_ mirror mounts that can fit the myriad dimensions of holes in Caterham side-screens. They have 2 pivots and can span a large range which should fit any set of side screens. the mount also stops the mirrors from clouting the windscreen when you open the door.

I've modified Convex Black Lifeline mirrors and replaced the imperial grub screws with M3 grub screws which are much bigger stronger and are a standard metric hex size.

## How much are they?
£150 including delivery for everything, modified mirrors, mounts and all bolts. (mirrors from elsewhere will cost around 60quid delivered and you'll need to fix the grubscrews yourself)
£80 including delivery for just the mounts.
if you want different mirrors from Lifeline, I can get them for you, but I'll need to give you a price.

## What do I need?
* 2x Side screens that have been drilled for Caterham mirrors. (or just drill a hole if you don't have one)
* 2x brass pins from your hinges. note that if you have an SV chassis, you _may_ have the silver pins. if you do, please mention this in your order.
* 6x original nyloc nuts and washers from hinges and mirrors.
* loctite

## Fitting instructions
* tap the brass hinge pins out of the original hinges (or simply mount the hinge with the pin on the stanchion)
* remove your hinge on the side screen, keep the washers and bolts.
* unscrew the outer fitting of the base if it is attached.
* offer up the articulated mount to the side-screen and push the bolts through to line it all up. then tighten up the inner part of the base with a spanner and hex-key (loctite it first), being careful to not move the parts. this can be tightened tightly. You can fit the small screw in the pivot (loctite it!).
* refit the outer base with the mirror. you can tighten down the mirror with a 19mm spanner until the mirror is nice and tight but still adjustable. once you have this tight enough, screw in the grub/caphead screw into the base outer to lock the mirror's tension in place. don't over-tighten this as it's only aluminium and will strip.

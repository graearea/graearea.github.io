The Jamaican Bacon Clip
- Precision quick release clip for post-trail-line smashing
- Tested and proven to cope with riding Sheet trails and Sandwich trails
- Fits standard bottle cage mounts.
- Can also accept dual zipties and/or vhb tape.
- comes with a strip of VHB to stop it moving about laterally whilst the zipties take the weight
- rear is curved to fit snugly to 34mm tube but will happily cope with BMX tube dia or slightly bigger.
- secure hold of your favourite 330ml/440ml drink (n.b. Guinness cans are weird sized due to widget.)
- I can do any colour that I have the filament for, so just ask
- if you say "bacon" in a Jamaican accent ...

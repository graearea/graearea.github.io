# Jamaican Bacon Clip
![plugs](img/bacon.jpg)

- Precision quick release clip for post-trail-line smashing or road-beer sipping
- Tested and proven to cope with riding Sheet trails and Sandwich trails
- Comes with a strip of VHB to stop it moving about laterally whilst 2 zipties take the weight
- Or can fit standard bottle cage mounts.
- Rear is curved to fit snugly to 34mm tube but will happily cope with BMX seattube or slightly bigger.
- Secure hold of your favourite 330ml/440ml drink (also Guinness cans but they are weird sized due to widget.)
- Any colour that I have the filament for, so just ask
- If you say "bacon" in a Jamaican accent ...

# How secure is it?
this is midair over sheet trails last jump which has a 6 foot takeoff:

First time I finished the line, I smashed a beer! 

So decide:
- with or without bottle boss holes
- colour
- 330: £12 + £3 p&p
- 440: £14 + £3 p&p

discount for multiples (including delivery):
- 1=£15
- 2=£25
- 3=£33
- 4=£39

but you really don't need 4 :D (ridiculous maybe, but I needed to test them)
